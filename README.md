Objective:
The primary objective of this online voting system is to provide a simple, secure, and user-friendly platform for users to cast their votes electronically. This system aims to streamline the voting process, ensuring quick and accurate vote counting, and allowing easy access to voting for eligible users.

Technologies Used:
Java Swing: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
Java AWT: For handling user input and action events.
JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, JRadioButton, JButton: For building the components of the GUI.
ButtonGroup: To group radio buttons for candidate selection.
ActionListener: To handle button click events.
Features and Components:
User Interface (UI):

Frame: The main window of the application where all components are placed.
Labels: To prompt users to enter their name and age, and to select a candidate.
TextFields: For users to input their name and age.
RadioButtons: For users to select their preferred candidate.
Button: A "Vote" button for submitting the vote.
Result Label: To display messages and results to the user.
Backend Logic:

Vote Counting: Keeps track of the votes for each candidate.
Validation: Ensures that users are eligible to vote (i.e., they are 18 years or older).
Feedback: Provides feedback to the user after they cast their vote.
Working of the Application:
User Inputs: The user enters their name and age, and selects a candidate.
Validation: The system checks if the entered age is valid (a number) and if the user is 18 years or older.
Vote Casting: If the user is eligible, the vote is recorded for the selected candidate. If no candidate is selected, the user is prompted to select one.
Result Display: A thank you message is displayed to the user, and the vote count for each candidate is printed to the console.
Example Code Analysis:
The provided code is a basic implementation of the online voting system using Java Swing. Here's a breakdown:

Main Frame Setup:

The JFrame is set up with a title and size.
Various components like JLabel, JTextField, JRadioButton, and JButton are added to the frame.
Event Handling:

An ActionListener is attached to the "Vote" button to handle the vote casting logic.
User input is validated, and appropriate messages are displayed based on the user's age and candidate selection.
Vote Counting Logic:

Vote counts for each candidate are maintained as static variables.
Based on the selected radio button, the corresponding candidate's vote count is incremented.
Conclusion:
This basic online voting system provides a starting point for developing a more comprehensive and secure electronic voting application. Enhancements could include database integration for persistent storage of votes, user authentication, and encryption to ensure the security and integrity of the voting process.
